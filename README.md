#Description
Basic platformer game using Quintus.  Project 1 for GA WDI.  Includes user authentication, jQuery validation, and various node modules.  Functionality includes comments based on user.

#Icebox
At some point, I would like to get my leaderboard to work; automatically adding the username, time, and coins to the database, mergesorting, and appending the top 10 times/scores to the leaderboard.<br><br>Additionally, I'm having some trouble with the embedded comment data, in that it is adding username and comments as new seperate elements each time a new comment is added; so username is listed repeatedly, and comments aren't nestled in an array.<br><br>Eventually of course, I'd like to make the level hard, and add animations to the player.

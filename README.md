#Description
Basic platformer game using Quintus.  Project 1 for GA WDI.  Includes user authentication, jQuery Validation, and various node modules. Functionality includes comments based on user.

#Icebox
At some point, I would like to get a leaderboard to work; automatically adding the username, time, and coins to the database, mergesorting, and appending the top 10 times/scores to the leaderboard.<br><br>Additionally, I'm having some trouble with the embedded comment data, in that it is adding username and comments as new seperate elements each time a new comment is added; so username is listed repeatedly, and comments aren't nestled in an array.

#Live
This app is live on <a href="https://sbelser-platformer.herokuapp.com/">Heroku</a>.

#How To Bootstrap
